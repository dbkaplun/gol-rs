The Game of Life in Rust
------------------------

A straightforward implementation of the Game of Life, written in Rust.

This codebase is my learn-rust playground and so exercises new Rust
features as I learn them.

See also [gol-tcod][gol-tcod] built using the excellent [libtcod][tcod] 
library via [tcod-rs][tcod-rs].

game of life files.
